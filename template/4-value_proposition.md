# The Value Proposition

Echo offers a centralized platform both for potential event participants and event organizers. Organizers are offered facilities to create events and
share them to targeted users (e.g. followers) but also to the general public. Said audience is able to find, discover and be notified of events geared
to their interests. The relationship between participants and organizers is the cornerstone of our value proposition.
While our POC was definitely geared towards users on the audience end of the relationship, our vision is to offer value to both ends.

To the audience, we offer:

- A user-friendly tool to find events aligned with their interests and hobbies, or to expand them by discovering nearby events from previously unkown categories.

- A personnalized feed of recommendations for events they might want to attend.
At the beginning, the feed is based on simple user analytics, such as tags in their profile, in that of their friends or in the associations they follow,
but also on their activity: events that they, or their friends, have participated in, interactions with said events, etc. This value would
only increase with time and growth of user count, as more data would allow for more complex sorting algorithms.

- A platform to stay informed in real-time about events happening around them.

To the event creators, we offer:

- A platform where they can share their events with known participants, but that also allows them to reach new audiences.

- A platform to centralize all their hosting related needs: ticketing, advertising, real-time communication with participants.

Most associations at EPFL are familiar with the struggles of hosting events, such as finding participants or dealing with communication and
advertising.
Echo offers a clear benefit to them because it provides direct support in these struggles.
Furthermore, there is nothing specific to EPFL about these pain points, so we can safely affirm that this benefits apply to any association or
individual hosting an event, which is why, even if EPFL would be our starting point, the value we provide supercedes any geographical boundary.

Furthermore, Echo presents itself as an attractive tool to potential participants, because it removes
the need to scrape their social media feed, their mailbox and the web just to find an enjoyable activity to participate in.

Echo offers particular value to individuals looking to meet new people, make new friends and improve their social insertion.

Echo is definitely relevant to the EPFL student population, students probably being the most frequent creators of events and the most frequent participants.
Nonetheless, as long as anyone is free to create and share an event about anything, Echo will find its relevance even in the smallest population
segments.

At its core, Echo provides a wide array of services to both participants and organizers, and a number of such services will include a small fee (e.g. for ticketing).

Finally, the nature of the app makes it particularly easy to collect advertising fees, or even to strike deals with companies who wish to promote their events.

However, Echo must ensure that said monetization doesn't interfere in any significant way with customer acquisition or with the usability of the app.
