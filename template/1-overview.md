# Overview

As students, we've all been faced with exam weeks and revisions, forcing us to fully focus on our studies during those tough times while suffering with loneliness and a lack of human interactions. One-third of students in the world have reported feeling lonely and depressive during those periods. With Study Buddies, we aim to fully merge the joy of feeling socially active and still being able to study efficiently. 

Study Buddies promotes collaboration through shared resources and a better studying environment by using useful tools such as timers, calendars, app lockers and much others. With Study Buddies, we want to prove that studying doesn't have to be lonely and stressful but can also a great bonding moment with friends, near or far.
