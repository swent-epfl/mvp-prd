# Overview  
  

>*Imagine a social network where every post becomes a destination, encouraging you to step out and explore. It’s not just about scrolling through life—it's about living it, one post at a time.*  
  
  
Proxima transforms the way people connect online by anchoring social interactions in real-world locations. Users can create and share posts, with a unique twist: to read a post, users must physically visit the location where it was published.

By blending social media with location-based logic, Proxima aims to bridge the gap between virtual connections and physical presence by encouraging users to discover and share interesting locations. Users are encouraged to discover and interact with new locations, promoting outdoor activity and real-world engagement.

The app provides various features, such as post creation, location-based feeds, commenting, voting, and earning rewards. Users are challenged to visit nearby posts, earning Centauri points as rewards for their explorations. The gamified experience adds a competitive element to content discovery, making it more engaging and rewarding.

Proxima is free for all users, with the primary target audience being social media enthusiasts and explorers.

The goal of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is to establish a solid user base, gauging success through metrics like downloads, active users, and user engagement levels. By achieving significant penetration, we aim to attract interest from potential partners and investors for future development.

Proxima is currently available on Android and is planned to be released on IOS.
