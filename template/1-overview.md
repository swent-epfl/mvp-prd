# Overview

*Maximum: 2 pages*

*What is this project about?*
- Event Radar is an app that helps to _easily_ facilitate connections with others
- it allows users to discover and register for upcoming events in their area, and easily connect with friends they meet
- it also allows event hosts to easily create and manage events, and even scan tickets for event goers
- all of this is done through one all-purpose, unique QR code

*Describe succinctly and precisely its purpose.*
- provides a one-stop shop to find events, connect with new friends, message people, and even host events
- removes the barriers to creating connections after the event (by scanning QR codes to add friends, you no longer need to remember someone's name the next day. Simply go to the app and you'll find their information easily.)

*Include a 3-sentence (max) elevator pitch.*
