# Analysis of the Situation

## Competing Products
Currently, hot-air balloon companies are using seperate tools for each aspect of their business and some of them aren't even well tailored to their needs.
So the direct competition is pretty much inexistant. However, on some key features like the during flight map, to coordinate the ballon with the crews, there's some professional apps available so we would need to make our product on par with the technical aspects of our competitors to make the transition to our all-in-one app smooth and appealing.

## Complementary Products
They are a few complementary products available that would enhance the experience for both operators and costumers:
- Weather Monitoring Tools, to see and adapt to the weather
- Payment Gateways, to facilitate secure and convenient payment processing.
- Marketing and Promotion Tools, to help the business promote its services and manage marketing campaigns.
- Photography and Videography Services, to capture memorable moments during the balloon flight.
