### Description of V1 PoC as Planned by Sprint 10
As of the Sprint10, our POC has a lot of key features that are needed for the final app. Thoses includes:
- Users that can differentiate between Crew, Admin and Pilot with the possibility of adding and managing users as an admin.
- Calendars to handle availabilities of pilots and crews.
- The possibility to plan and assign and modify flights as an admin and start them as pilot.
- A messaging service between members of the same confirmed flight.
- A map component that can show the trajectory speed and other important metrics for crews and pilots to coordinate during the flight.

## What did we learn?
- How to handle tasks that have dependencies.
- To define a clear routine of when to meet for standup.
- How to define tasks by communicating on how they depend on each other.
- Build team spirit for a good communication between all members.

## Bridging the Gap from PoC to MVP
Some of the features that would be necessary to our final app would be:
- A weather widget to prepare for the day of flight
- Admin statistics for interesting and useful data to exploit easily, like salaries per member etc.
- More personalisation especially for the during flight map
- Notification to alert employees to their assigned flights
