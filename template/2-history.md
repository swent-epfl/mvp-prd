The V1 PoC of Event Radar, as planned by Sprint 10, includes essential features that demonstrate the app's core functionalities (see more in the MVP section). At sign-up, users receive a unique QR code that acts as their event entry ticket and allows them to share their profile with others. Then, users can browse and sign up for upcoming events, connect with other users by scanning their QR code, and engage in in-app private messaging. Users can also personalize their experience by customizing their profiles, enabling them to connect more effectively with others and build a strong community. Additionally, event hosts can create and edit events, and scan the tickets of event goers to verify their entry.

Throughout the development of the PoC, our team faced several learning curves, particularly with the Scrum process. Initially, we encountered challenges with managing large pull requests (PRs) and task clarity, which we addressed by refining task definitions on the Scrum board and limiting the PR scope, leading to fewer dependencies between tasks. Furthermore, the ambitious nature of the app required us to make difficult prioritization decisions due to limited time. 

Despite these challenges, we successfully laid the groundwork for the MVP. However, further development is needed to implement additional user flows and define features such as group chats, in-event geo-location, and event history tracking to bridge from PoC to MVP. Also, further database privacy and security efforts need to be made to protect user data and establish trust with the customers.
