The V1 PoC of Event Radar, as planned by Sprint 10, includes essential features that demonstrate the core functionalities of the app (see more in the MVP section). Users can browse and see upcoming events, engage in in-app private messaging, and utilize QR code generation and scanning for seamless connections. Users can also personalize their experience with editable profiles, providing a foundation for building a local community and facilitating meaningful connections. Additionally, event hosts have the ability to create and edit events, ensuring effective event management.

Throughout the development of the PoC, our team faced several learning curves, particularly with the Scrum process. Initially, we encountered challenges with managing large pull requests (PRs) and task clarity, which we addressed by refining task definitions on the Scrum board and limiting the PR scope, which also lead to less dependencies between tasks. Furthermore, the ambitious nature of Event Radar required us to make difficult prioritization decisions due to limited time. Despite these challenges, we successfully laid the groundwork for the MVP, although further development is needed to implement additional user flows and defining features such as group chats, in-event geo-location, and event history tracking to fully bridge from PoC to MVP.
