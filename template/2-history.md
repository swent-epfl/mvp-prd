*Describe the V1 POC as planned by Sprint10.*

The V1 Proof of Concept (PoC) for Polyfit, as planned by Sprint10, focused on creating a basic yet functional calorie tracking app utilizing the phone camera for image recognition. The core functionalities included:

- Calorie Tracking: Users can take a picture of their food to create a meal with an estimation of calorie content, with detailed nutritional breakdowns.
- Manual Meal Creation: A process to create and log new meals without a photo.
- Manual Adjustments: Users have the ability to edit their meals after and during creation.
- Daily Tracking: The app allows users to log their meals and track daily calorie intake through daily recaps.
- Graphical Overview: Users can view a graph of their calorie consumption over time.
- Social Features: Basic social media-like features were incorporated, enabling users to share their meals and progress with nearby friends based on GPS location.
- Offline Mode: The app is designed to work offline, with the ability to sync data when the user is back online.
- Barcode Scanning: A feature to scan barcodes for automatic meal creation and calorie tracking.

*What did you learn?*

From the development and deployment of the V1 PoC, several key insights were gained:

- Image Analysis Challenges: Using image recognition to detect quantities and weight of food items was more complex than anticipated, requiring further refinement.
- Intentionality of code: The importance of writing clean, well-documented code was highlighted to ensure scalability and maintainability.
- Usability: The importance of a user-friendly interface and smooth navigation was underscored by testing/grading feedback.


*What is missing to bridge from PoC to MVP?*

To bridge from the PoC to the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), some key features and improvements are necessary:

- Improved Image Recognition: Enhance the accuracy and speed of image recognition for better meal tracking.
- Enhanced User Experience: Refine the user interface and experience to be more intuitive and engaging.
