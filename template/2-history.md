## V1 PoC for PetPamper

The V1 proof-of-concept (PoC) for PetPamper was designed to showcase the fundamental functionality of the application and test its viability in a real-world setting. The PoC included essential features such as Groomer Discovery, Appointment Scheduling, and an In-app Messaging System. These features enabled users to locate nearby groomers, book grooming appointments, and communicate with groomers directly through the app. The primary objective was to create a streamlined user experience that demonstrated the potential of PetPamper to simplify pet grooming management.

## What we learnt

Through the implementation and testing of the PoC, we gathered valuable insights:

User Engagement: We observed high user engagement with the Groomer Discovery and Appointment Scheduling features, indicating a strong demand for convenient pet grooming solutions. Users appreciated the ability to easily find and book grooming services.

Technical Challenges: The PoC highlighted several technical challenges, particularly in ensuring real-time updates for appointment scheduling and maintaining secure user authentication. These challenges underscored the need for a more robust and scalable architecture.

User Feedback: Feedback from initial users indicated a desire for additional features such as detailed groomer profiles, user reviews, and more flexible scheduling options. Users also expressed interest in expanding the app's capabilities to include other pet care services.

## Bridging from PoC to MVP

To transition from the PoC to a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), several key enhancements and features need to be implemented:

Scalable Architecture: Redesigning the app's architecture to support scalability and extensibility. This includes modularizing features to allow for easier updates and integration of additional services in the future.

Enhanced Security: Implementing more robust security measures, such as OAuth2 for secure logins and encrypted data storage, to protect user information and transactions.

Payment Integration: Integrating secure and reliable payment gateways to facilitate transactions within the app. This is crucial for enabling the monetization strategy of taking a commission on bookings.

User Experience Improvements: Refining the user interface and experience to ensure smooth and intuitive interactions. This includes optimizing the in-app messaging system and ensuring real-time updates for appointments.

By addressing these areas, we can ensure that the MVP of PetPamper not only meets the current needs of pet owners and groomers but also lays the foundation for future growth and expansion in the pet care industry.
