# Timeline/Resource Planning

## Execution Roadmap

The MVP development will be completed over a 14-week period, including setup, development, testing, rollout, and feature iteration. The team consists of 1 frontend developer, 1 backend developer/DevOps engineer, 1 part-time UI/UX designer, and 1 part-time software tester.

### Milestone 1: Design Completion and Technical Setup

- Document APIs, request-response parameters
- Develop UI elements for profile creation and event discovery: dropdowns, filters, buttons, etc.
- Create Figma mockups and user flow documents
- Implement user registration and integration
- Conduct initial tests to populate UI elements with sample data

| **Sprint/Week Number** | **Objective** | **Outcomes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week 1 | Kickoff and Documentation | Investigate APIs, document them, create scraping prototype scripts, set up project tools, and establish MVP scope. |
| Week 2 | Design and Technical Setup | Create initial wireframes and user flows, start UI mockups with elements for event discovery, configure user registration and integration. |
| Week 3 | Design Finalization & Application Skeleton | Finalize UI/UX designs, set up development environments, and create backend APIs to populate simple UI elements. |

### Milestone 2: Core Feature Development

- Prototype core features weekly with appropriate API mock integration
- Test on multiple devices; refine design for different screen sizes

| **Sprint/Week Number** | **Objective** | **Outcomes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week 4 | Event Discovery Feature Development | Develop the event discovery feature end-to-end, integrate frontend-backend, begin unit testing. |
| Week 5 | Event Participation Feature Development | Complete the event participation feature, continue integration and unit testing, support multiple device types. |
| Week 6 | Association Admin Interface Development | Develop the admin interface for associations, integrate all features in the frontend, conduct internal testing. |
| Week 7 | Unit and Integration Testing | Write remaining unit tests, verify frontend-backend integration with integration tests. |

### Milestone 3: Internal Testing and Pre-Launch Preparation

- Conduct end-to-end tests on multiple devices
- Perform stress testing for peak load, average load, and API latency
- Implement error handling and logging for API failures

| **Sprint/Week Number** | **Objective** | **Outcomes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week 8 | Internal Testing & Analytics/Monitoring Pipelines | Conduct thorough internal testing, load testing, gather feedback, fix bugs, and perform performance testing. |
| Week 9 | Pre-Launch Preparations | Address final bug fixes and optimizations, prepare app store and launch materials. |

### Milestone 4: Initial Rollout and Feature Iterations for PMF

- Roll out the app to alpha testers

| **Sprint/Week Number** | **Objective** | **Outcomes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weeks 10-11 | Initial Rollout/Alpha Testing | Deploy the app to production, monitor performance, gather user analytics and feedback, implement hotfixes as needed. |
| Week 12 | Feature Iteration 1 | Identify drop-off points, optimize user experience, roll out updates, and improve the UI. |
| Week 13 | Beta Testing | Initiate marketing, onboard users, promptly address feedback to build trust. |
| Week 14 | Full Rollout | Intensify marketing efforts, offer incentives for app downloads, such as free meals for lucky winners. |

## Development Resources

The primary cost of developing the product will be the developers' salaries. We estimate the need to secure four months of funding for a four-person team to accommodate both planned and unforeseen scenarios. Realistically, this project requires two full-time developers (one frontend, one backend/DevOps), along with two part-time contractors for UI design and testing. We expect the contractors to contribute a total of two person-months each over the 4-month development and go-to-market timeframe. We will allocate additional funds for a total of four person-months to cover unexpected deviations from our roadmap.

| **Function** | **Required Person-Months** |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend Developer | 4 |
| Backend Developer | 4 |
| UI/UX Designer | 2 |
| Software Tester | 2 |
| Surplus Cash Reserves | 4 |
