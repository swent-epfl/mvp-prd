# Business Model

Our core business model will be based on a freemium model, where the app will be free to use with ads and usage limits. Users can opt for a subscription model to remove ads, remove usage limits, and access premium features. We will also explore other revenue streams such as ad revenue and sponsored recipes/ingredients.

This business model is chosen to get users onboarded quickly and test the app's features. We believe that once users see the value in the app, they will be more likely to subscribe to the premium model. The freemium model also allows us to gather feedback from a larger set of users and iterate on the app to improve user experience.

In terms of operating costs, our main costs will be cloud hosting and 3rd party API usage costs. When bringing image recognition in-house, we will cut back on the API usage, but we will have to invest in training, maintaining, and deploying the model. 

A large part of our success will hinge on users' trying out the app and seeing the value in it. We will focus on marketing and user acquisition to get the app in front of as many users as possible. We can expect to have a large portion of cost coming from Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) in the initial months. We will have to keep a close eye on the CAC and Lifetime Value (LTV) to ensure that we are acquiring users profitably.
