### Revenue Streams:

Our primary revenue stream will come from a subscription-based model where hot-air balloon companies pay a monthly fee to access our software. The fee structure will be tiered based on the size of the business, primarily determined by the number of employees and the scale of operations. This approach not only ensures scalability of revenue but also aligns our growth with the growth of our clients, providing a sustainable and predictable income stream.

- Basic Tier: For small companies with limited employees and fewer balloons.
- Professional Tier: For medium-sized companies with more complex operations and staff requirements.
- Enterprise Tier: Custom solutions for large companies with extensive operations and high demands for customization and support.

Additionally, we will explore revenue through offering customized features, add-ons, and dedicated support packages that companies can opt into based on their specific needs.
