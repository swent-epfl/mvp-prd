# The MVP

## Personas and Scenarios

The Student Sphere MVP aims to bring all student associations' most used resources under one roof to meet the value proposition identified above. High user retention will serve as a key metric for EPFL to ensure the success and sustainability of this service for its students. We identify ICPs (Ideal Customer Profiles) below and list the set of features that we think are used enough to generate repeat traffic.

Concretely, we aim to integrate the following services into Student Sphere:

    1.	News feed - Keeps students informed about the latest happenings within the associations.
    2.	Event feed - Provides information about upcoming events, making it easy for students to stay engaged with association activities.
    3.	Association details page - Offers comprehensive information about each association.
    4.	Application for staffing at events - Simplifies the process of applying to staff at events, making it easier for students to get involved.
    5.	Application for joining an association - Streamlines the membership application process, encouraging more students to join associations.
    6.	Ticket system - An integrated system for ticket attribution, ensuring seamless allocation and management of tickets for event attendees.
    7.	NFC ticket scanning system - Provides a convenient method for checking tickets at events, enhancing the overall event management experience.
    8.	Association management - Allows members of an association to manage their association's page, events, news, applications, and tickets.
