# The MVP

## Personas and Scenarios

The key persona is people who enjoy monitoring their health.

### Other Target Personas
- People trying to gain muscle mass/weight
- People going through weight loss journeys
- People who enjoy cooking and want to try new recipes
- Athletes

<!-- *High-level scenarios to adopt, use and share the product.* -->
## Adoption Scenarios

In order to grow our user base, our goal is to get the app in front of as many people as possible. Because our product is easy to understand and use, we believe that once people try it, they will continue to use it. We will focus on the following scenarios to grow our user base:

1. Social Media Sharing
    - Users can share their meals on social media platforms to show off their healthy lifestyle.
2. Influencer Partnerships
    - We will partner with influencers in the health and fitness space to promote our app.
3. Community Sharing
    - As users begin to post within the app, more members of the community will be drawn in to see what others are eating.

## User Stories and Key Features

### User Stories

1. Daily Calorie Tracking: A user takes a picture of their meal, and the app provides the calorie count.
2. Healthy Meal Inspiration: A user searches for recipes based on dietary preferences.
3. Barcode Scanning: A user scans a barcode to get the nutritional information of a product.
4. Data Charts: A user views a chart of their daily calorie intake over time.
5. Social Sharing: A user shares their meal with neighbors in their community.

### Key Features

Here are the key features required for the MVP and their importance:

1. More flexible nutrient tracking (more than calroies & macros)
    - People who track their micro nutrient will require a feature that accepts more detailed nutritional information when creating ingredients.
2. Health app integration
    - People who are monitoring their weight will require a feature that integrates with health apps to monitor their weight and display progress. 
    - Otherwise, they will have to manually input their weight into the app which is time-consuming and inconvenient.
3. Improved image recognition
    - People who are depending on the image recognition feature will require highly accurate nutritional analysis.
    - If not, they will have to manually input the nutritional information which defeats our differentiation from other apps.
4. Saved Ingredients
    - People who frequently use the same ingredients will require a feature that allows them to save ingredients for future use. 
    - If not, they will have to manually input the same ingredients every time they create a meal which is a poor user experience.


## Success Criteria

Our MVP will be considered successful if we achieve the following:

- Grow to 10,000 active users within the first 6 months
    - We will measure user penetration through the number of downloads and active users
- 80% of users are satisfied with the app
    - We will measure satisfaction through in-app satisfaction surveys
- 10% of users are willing to pay for premium features
    - If we can get 10% of users to pay for premium features, the app will achieve financial sustainability


### Partnerships

In order to further grow our user base, partnerships would provide a great opportunity. We would consider partnerships with the following:

1. Gyms
    - Offering the premium features of the app at a discounted or free rate to gym members
2. Health Food Companies
    - Add a QR code to the packaging of products that can be scanned to give trials of premium features

## Features Outside the Scope

We have many features that we would like to include in the app, but are not necessary for the MVP. These features include:

- Allergen tracking
    - Upon scanning a meal, the app will identify any allergens present in the meal.
- Recipe recommendations by dietary preferences
    - The app will recommend recipes based on the user's dietary preferences.
- Fitness Programs
    - The app will provide fitness programs to help users achieve their health goals.
- Nutrient Coaching
    - Through Generative AI, the app will provide nutrient coaching to teach users which nutrients they are lacking in their diet, and why they are important.

Once we have achieved success with the MVP, we will consider integrating these features into the app. The priority will be given to features directly related to food and nutrition, and then we will consider features that are more fitness-oriented. As such, we would prioritize allergen tracking and recipe recommendations before fitness programs and nutrient coaching.
