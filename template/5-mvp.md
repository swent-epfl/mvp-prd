## Features Outside the Scope

While additional pet services such as veterinary appointments and dietary consultations are valuable, they can be integrated in future updates after establishing the core grooming service. Advanced health tracking integration, which involves incorporating pet health tracking devices and features, will be introduced in later versions to enhance the overall wellness ecosystem. Developing a marketplace for pet care products will be considered once a substantial user base is established.

### Integration Sequence:

We would firstly, introduce additional pet services like veterinary appointments and dietary consultations based on user demand and feedback. Then, integrate advanced health tracking devices and features to provide comprehensive pet wellness solutions. Finally, launch a pet care product marketplace to offer users a one-stop-shop for all their pet care needs, leveraging the existing user base.
