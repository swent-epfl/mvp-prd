# The MVP

## Personas and Scenarios

<!-- *Who are the target personas for this product?* -->

- Athletes
- People who enjoy monitoring their health
- People trying to gain muscle mass/weight
- People going through weight loss journeys
- People who enjoy cooking and want to try new recipes

<!-- *Which is the key persona?* -->

- The key persona is people who enjoy monitoring their health.

*High-level scenarios to adopt, use and share the product.*

## User Stories and Key Features

<!-- *User stories about how various personas will use the product in context.* -->

- Someone who wants to track their daily calorie intake will take a picture of their meal and the app will provide them with the calorie count.
- Someone who is looking for healthy meal inspiration will be able to search for recipes based on their dietary preferences.
- Someone who is looking to gain muscle mass will be able to track their protein intake.
- Someone who is going through a weight loss journey will be able to track their daily calorie intake and set goals for themselves.

<!-- *Identify and prioritise the key features required.* -->
<!-- *Justify the importance of each feature.* -->

1. More flexible nutrient tracking (more than calroies & macros)
    - People who track their micro nutrient will require a feature that accepts more detailed nutritional information when creating ingredients.
2. Health app integration
    - People who are monitoring their weight will require a feature that integrates with health apps to monitor their weight and display progress. Otherwise, they will have to manually input their weight into the app which is time-consuming and inconvenient.
3. Improved image recognition
    - People who are depending on the image recognition feature will require highly accurate nutritional analysis. If not, they will have to manually input the nutritional information which defeats our differentiation from other apps.
4. Saved Ingredients
    - People who frequently use the same ingredients will require a feature that allows them to save ingredients for future use. If not, they will have to manually input the same ingredients every time they create a meal which is a poor user experience.


## Success Criteria

<!-- *How will you evaluate the success of the MVP?* -->

Our MVP will be considered successful if we achieve the following:

- Grow to 10,000 active users within the first 6 months
    - We will measure user penetration through the number of downloads and active users
- 80% of users are satisfied with the app
    - We will measure satisfaction through in-app satisfaction surveys
- 10% of users are willing to pay for premium features
    - If we can get 10% of users to pay for premium features, the app will achieve financial sustainability


<!-- *Metrics include user penetration, quality / satisfaction.* -->

<!-- *If applicable, progress in discussions with ecosystem partners / investors / customers.* -->

## Features Outside the Scope

We have many features that we would like to include in the app, but are not necessary for the MVP. These features include:

- Allergen tracking
    - Upon scanning a meal, the app will identify any allergens present in the meal.
- Recipe recommendations by dietary preferences
    - The app will recommend recipes based on the user's dietary preferences.
- Fitness Programs
    - The app will provide fitness programs to help users achieve their health goals.
- Nutrient Coaching
    - Through Generative AI, the app will provide nutrient coaching to teach users which nutrients they are lacking in their diet, and why they are important.

Once we have achieved success with the MVP, we will consider integrating these features into the app. The priority will be given to features directly related to food and nutrition, and then we will consider features that are more fitness-oriented. As such, we would prioritize allergen tracking and recipe recommendations before fitness programs and nutrient coaching.

<!-- *The MVP must be viable and minimal.* -->

<!-- *Which features donâ€™t belong in it.* -->

<!-- *How should these be eventually integrated and in what sequence.* -->
