#### Goal: Understand how users are using the app

## Key Metrics

#### Number of Registered Groomers:
The total number of groomers registered on the app.
Geographical distribution of groomers compared to demographic data.

#### Number of Booked Appointments:
The key metric for measuring app usage.
Total appointments booked by users.

#### User Retention:
The percentage of users who continue to use the app over time.
Repeat booking rates for both pet owners and groomers.

## Success Criteria

#### Sufficient Numbers of Registered Groomers:
Ensure that there are enough registered groomers in each populated area to provide users with options.

#### User Engagement:
50% of users who booked one appointment should book several more.

## Analysis Plan

Data Collection: Use Firebase Analytics to collect and analyze data. Ensure that all collected data is anonymized to protect user privacy.

Data Tracking: Implement tracking for key metrics such as user sign-ups, appointments booked, and user retention.

Dashboard and Reports: Create dashboards and regular reports to monitor and analyze the key metrics.

## A/B Testing Ideas

1. Groomer Display Priority:
   
Test different criteria for prioritizing groomers in search results (e.g., distance, ratings, availability) to determine which helps pet owners find suitable groomers more easily.

2. Information Layout:

Experiment with different layouts for displaying groomer profiles, including the arrangement of reviews, photos, and services offered, to see which format is more effective in helping users make decisions.

##
By focusing on these key metrics, success criteria, and A/B testing ideas, PetPamper can effectively understand user behavior, improve user engagement, and continuously refine the app to better meet the needs of pet owners and groomers.
