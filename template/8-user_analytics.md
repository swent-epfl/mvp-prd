# User Analytics and Acceptance

#### Goal: Understand how users are using the app

## Key Metrics

#### Number of Registered Groomers:
The total number of groomers registered on the app.
Geographical distribution of groomers compared to demographic data.

#### Number of Booked Appointments:
The key metric for measuring app usage.
Total appointments booked by users.

#### User Retention:
The percentage of users who continue to use the app over time.
Repeat booking rates for both pet owners and groomers.

## Success Criteria

#### Sufficient Numbers of Registered Groomers:
Ensure that there are enough registered groomers in each populated area to provide users with options.

#### User Engagement:
50% of users who booked one appointment should book several more.

## Analysis Plan

Data Collection: Use Firebase Analytics to collect and analyze data. Ensure that all collected data is anonymized to protect user privacy.

Data Tracking: Implement tracking for key metrics such as user sign-ups, appointments booked, and user retention.

Dashboard and Reports: Create dashboards and regular reports to monitor and analyze the key metrics.

## A/B Testing Ideas

1. Groomer Display Priority:
   
Test different criteria for prioritizing groomers in search results (e.g., distance, ratings, availability) to determine which helps pet owners find suitable groomers more easily.

2. Information Layout:

Experiment with different layouts for displaying groomer profiles, including the arrangement of reviews, photos, and services offered, to see which format is more effective in helping users make decisions.

By focusing on these key metrics, success criteria, and A/B testing ideas, PetPamper can effectively understand user behavior, improve user engagement, and continuously refine the app to better meet the needs of pet owners and groomers.
